## 2024 For Me

It's hard to believe that 2024 has already come to an end. This year was filled with valuable lessons and personal growth in various aspects of life. You might wonder, "With all the wonderful memories and enjoyable moments from 2024, why focus on learning?" Well, I've realized that life is a never-ending journey, and this year taught me invaluable lessons that I will carry with me forever. So, what are the lessons that I often refer to? Let me break down what I learned in this year, or should I say the "Subject" that I learned from 2024. Here it is!

#### Enjoy Small Things

I graduated from college this year—hooray! I am officially a Bachelor of Computer Science, having completed my studies at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember in Surabaya,
Indonesia. This milestone fills me with both excitement and nervousness, as I am getting closer to becoming the "adult" I always wondered about when I was a boy.
I can confidently say that my college life was well spent. Things like traveling, and playing some sports that I like, are becoming my almost daily activities in my last semester this year. Here some of the moments I took when I was busy enjoying life lol.

I'm a competitive person, and there's no doubt about it. Whether it's striving for academic achievements or playing small games like hide and seek, winning always satisfies me. However, this year has been particularly challenging for me, and it left me feeling stunned for a while. I've realized that my competitiveness isn’t going to take me anywhere further in life; instead, it feels more like envy of other people's achievements. This year, I recognize that my drive isn't just about being competitive—it's rooted in feelings of envy.
