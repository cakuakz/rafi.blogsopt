## Overview
Kalma is a mental health application which focuses on the user's self healing so users will not do a self diagnose that will lead to something bad. The primary goal of this app is to make users do the self healing method for their daily concern of their mental health state. This app provides 3 main features.

1. **Self Management**
   * Journaling
   * Music Meditation
   * Breathing Meditation

2. **Self Screening**
   * Users answer 40 questions from the **DASS-Y method** to get a mental health status result.

3. **Mental Health Articles**
   * Provides knowledge about mental health.

## Solution & Approach
The mobile app was developed with **Flutter**. It is interesting because my team and I had to create a robust mobile architecture, which was challenging since it was our first real-life mobile app project.

To improve app performance and make it dynamic for users, we used several key libraries:

### **Tech Stack**
- **Dio** → Handles HTTP requests efficiently
* **flutter_secure_storage** → Stores authentication tokens securely
* **Provider** → Manages state across widgets
* **Audioplayer** → Enables seamless audio playback
* **uni_links** → Handles deep linking for better navigation
* **Material Design** → Ensures a consistent UI experience

Here are the tech stacks that my team used to build the mobile app:

* **Flutter**
* **Dart**
* **PostgreSQL**
* **Next.js**
* **TypeScript**
