## Overview
MyMental is a web application designed to help people check their mental health condition through an initial screening test. The purpose of this test is to give users a general idea of their mental health based on their answers to a series of yes-or-no questions, which are sourced from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. While it does not provide a deep diagnosis, it offers helpful indications that can guide users toward taking more detailed assessments tailored to their needs. In short, this website serves as a 'frontliner' in mental health awareness, giving users an accessible first step in understanding their mental well-being.

## Things I Learn
Throughout the development of MyMental, I gained valuable experience and insights, especially in frontend engineering and team collaboration. I learned how to properly implement theming using Material UI, which allowed us to maintain a consistent and accessible design system across the application. I also applied the atomic design pattern in structuring the components, which made our codebase more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

In addition to technical skills, I learned how to overcome challenges related to communication and changing requirements within the team. During the project, we frequently faced shifts in direction and updated feature scopes. To stay on track, I practiced being more adaptable, clarified expectations early, and improved the way I communicated progress with my teammates. These experiences helped me code more effectively, prioritize better, and deliver features more confidently even in a fast-moving environment.
